# Directory-Application

The Directory Application will be used as a learning tool to develop my skills as a C#, .NET, and Angular 6.  The application will include the following technologies: 
1) .NET Core API 
2) Login Authentication
2) JWT 
3) API Authentication
3) Angular Front End
4) Messaging 
5) Commenting
6) User Profiles 
7) CRUD Operations 
8) ... 


## Java Web Token Authentication
Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. The application uses JWT for single sign-on because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.
